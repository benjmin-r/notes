Using Python Slice Objects to Index a ndarray
==============================================

Some times you just want to use an object(variable) to refering to those ``:`` functionalities in your python code, you can achieve this by::

    slice(none) # the same as [:]
    slice(start, stop) # the same as [start:stop]
    slice(none, stop)  # [:stop]
    slice(start, none) # [start:]
    slice(start, stop, step) # [start:stop:step]

Have fun :)
